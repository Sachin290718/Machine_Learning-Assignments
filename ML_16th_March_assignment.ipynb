    "To avoid overfitting in machine learning, you can use a combination of techniques and best practices. Here is a list of key preventive measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Cross-Validation: Cross-validation involves splitting your dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining data. This ensures that your model generalises well across different data splits. For example, in k-fold cross-validation, you divide your data into k subsets. You train and validate your model k times, using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set each time.\n",
    "2) Split Your Data: For training, validation, and testing, divide your data into distinct subsets. This ensures that your model is trained on one subset, hyperparameters are tuned on another, and performance is evaluated on a completely separate set. For example, you could use an 80/10/10 split, with 80% of the data going to training, 10% going to validation, and 10% going to testing.\n",
    "3) Regularization: Regularization techniques add penalty terms to the loss function to prevent the model from fitting the training data too closely. For example, in linear regression, L1 regularization (Lasso) adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function, encouraging some coefficients to become exactly zero. L2 regularization (Ridge) augments the loss function with the squared coefficient values."
